## Hello and welcome to my data science project ! 

This is a personal project that was also used to validate my *IBM Data Science Professional Certificate*.

The goal of this project is to answer the following question :
**Where is a “good place” to buy a house in France and at what price?**

You can learn about the project by reading the report here :
- <a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/blob/master/Report.pdf>  Project report</a>

The project details can be found in four separate jupyter notebooks:
-	<a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/blob/master/Preprocessing_communes_stats.ipynb> Pre-processing data about the communes </a>
-	<a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/blob/master/Preprocessing_house_transactions.ipynb > Pre-processing the real estate transaction records </a>
-	<a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/blob/master/Communes_analysis.ipynb > Data analysis </a>
-	<a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/blob/master/House_prices_modeling.ipynb  > Estimating house prices in Clermont-Ferrand</a>

You can download the HTML version of the choropleth maps generated during the project by right-clicking on the link bellow and choosing "save link as" : 
- <a href=https://github.com/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/raw/master/maps/age_median.html> Map of the population's age</a>
- <a href=https://github.com/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/raw/master/maps/density.html> Map of the population density</a>
- <a href=https://github.com/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/raw/master/maps/revenue_median.html>Map of the standard of living (median revenues of households)</a>
- <a href=https://github.com/Ashish-3/House-prices-in-France/raw/master/maps/Prix_m2.html> Map of house prices per metre square (average value)</a>

Or you can acces the PNG version of the maps by clicking on the images bellow :
